# Customer Calls Data Cleaning Project

This repository contains a Python project focused on cleaning and preparing a **Customer Calls List** dataset for further analysis. The raw dataset included inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues typical of real-world data collected from customer service interactions.

## Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to transform messy call log data into a clean, structured format that is ready for analysis. Tasks include:

- Standardizing column names
- Parsing and formatting date/time fields
- Handling missing or null values
- Removing duplicates
- Fixing inconsistent or invalid entries (e.g., phone numbers, call durations)

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains customer call records with fields such as:

- `Customer ID`
- `First Namer`
- `Last Name`
- `Phone Number`
- `Address`
- `Paying Customer `
- `Agent Name`

## Tools Used

`pandas` – data cleaning and transformation
`numpy` – handling numerical data and NaNs
`datetime` – parsing and formatting time fields
`jupyter notebook` – for step-by-step documentation and exploration
